# locmoss
Local MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) in Python

Inspired by [MOSS-winnowing-seqMatcher](https://github.com/agranya99/MOSS-winnowing-seqMatcher) and based on the winnowing algorithm:
> Schleimer, S., Wilkerson, D. S., & Aiken, A. (2003, June). Winnowing: local algorithms for document fingerprinting. In Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data (pp. 76-85).

See [Standford MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) for the original online service.
